# 3dscene
3d Scene for Cs-330
How do I approach designing software?
After working on this project I am now fairly comfortable with setting up OpenGL projects. I am able to set the scene and move objects around it as well as apply textures to objects. The design process I followed was to write code then debug over and over until I had a project that would launch. This is a standard practice I believe will follow me for the rest of my career in whatever I do. Try and try again.

How do I approach developing programs?
New strategies were everywhere in this project considering I have never touched openGL in my life. It was extremely time consuming and I had to try and try over and over again until I got it right. Every iteration of my project was visited multiple times when i broke something. I have come so far since the first intro to python class I have learned. I am not a big fan of using C++ or open gl and would prefer to never use it again.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Well if any instance comes up where I am using graphics adn visualizations again I will be prepared and now the process I must take. The hardships I have endured this term are preparing me for a future career with constant learning and challenges at every turn.
